- Minn. Stat. § 342.13: Home cultivation (8 plants, 4 flowering max)

## Penumbrant Prose Manual (PPM)

### What It Is
Analysis of **regulatory gaps, ambiguities, and gray areas** where the law is unclear, disputed, or evolving.

### What It Covers
- ⚠️ Where statutes are silent but enforcement happens anyway
- ⚠️ Conflicts between state/local/federal law
- ⚠️ Ambiguous language creating compliance uncertainty
- ⚠️ Enforcement patterns that contradict rule text
- ⚠️ Risk surfaces operators face despite following written law

### Example Content (Minnesota)
- "Enclosed, locked space" for home cultivation undefined - what qualifies?
- Metrc data privacy: law enforcement access standards unclear
- "Safety-sensitive position" exception to employment protections - no statutory definition
- Municipal "time, place, manner" vs. de facto prohibition - where's the line?
- Social equity verification documentation gaps

### Who Needs This
- Compliance teams navigating uncertain regulatory areas
- Legal counsel advising on gray-area operations
- Operators making strategic decisions in ambiguous spaces
- Investors assessing regulatory risk

## The Complete Picture: Why You Need Both

### Scenario 1: Building Employee Handbook

**LOTL Stack tells you:**
- Minnesota law prohibits pre-employment cannabis testing (Minn. Stat. § 181.950 et seq.)
- Exception exists for "safety-sensitive positions"
- Employers must offer rehabilitation before termination

**Penumbrant Prose Manual tells you:**
- "Safety-sensitive position" is undefined - risk of overbroad designation
- Case law hasn't clarified boundaries yet
- Recommended: Define conservatively to avoid litigation

**Result:** You build compliant policy (LOTL) while managing legal risk (Penumbrant Prose Manual).

---

### Scenario 2: Launching Delivery Service

**LOTL Stack tells you:**
- Minnesota authorizes delivery licenses (Minn. Stat. § 342.06)
- OCM rules govern delivery operations
- Customer age verification required

**Penumbrant Prose Manual tells you:**
- Cross-municipal delivery authority unclear
- If destination municipality prohibits retail, does that extend to delivery?
- OCM guidance still evolving - expect enforcement uncertainty

**Result:** You understand legal framework (LOTL) and anticipate compliance challenges (Penumbrant Prose Manual).

---

### Scenario 3: Home Cultivation Consulting

**LOTL Stack tells you:**
- Adults 21+ may cultivate 8 plants (4 flowering max)
- Must be in "enclosed, locked space"
- Must be "out of public view"

**Penumbrant Prose Manual tells you:**
- "Enclosed, locked space" undefined - locked greenhouse? Outdoor garden with fence?
- Landlords may prohibit cultivation despite statutory right - no case law yet
- Enforcement variability across jurisdictions

**Result:** You advise clients on legal rights (LOTL) and practical risks (Penumbrant Prose Manual).

# Contributing to the Potent Penaural Library

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your contributions help expand this library of customized legal insights for the greater good. Please follow these guidelines.

1. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feature/add-resource` or `fix/typo`).
2. Make small, focused changes and include sources and context when appropriate.
3. Keep commit messages clear. Use present-tense, and reference issues when relevant.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of the change and any testing steps.

## Content Guidelines

If you are submitting legal insights, regulatory interpretations, or statute-based analysis:
- Include sources and citations to relevant statutes or regulations
- Clearly distinguish insights and interpretations from direct legal advice
- Maintain the educational and informational nature of the library
- Ensure all content includes appropriate disclaimers

## Important Reminder

All contributions should maintain the library's core principle: these materials are customized insights based on real legal statute, but by no means constitute actual legal advice. Content should be designed to inform and educate, not to provide legal counsel.

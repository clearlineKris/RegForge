**Updated Guidance for Margin Notes:**

The term "Margin Notes" captures insights in the **penumbra of regulatory law**—the gray areas, ambiguities, and unarticulated implications within a regulatory framework. The focus should be on areas where the law is unclear, unwritten, or subject to interpretation.

**Key Focus Areas for Each Paper:**

1. **Statutory and Regulatory Ambiguities** - Vague language, undefined terms, and gaps in coverage
2. **Enforcement Discretion** - Inconsistent application across jurisdictions or agencies
3. **Multi-Jurisdictional Tensions** - Conflicts between overlapping regulatory authorities
4. **Case Law and Precedents** - How courts and agencies are filling regulatory gaps
5. **Stakeholder Asymmetry Analysis** - How information and power imbalances are exacerbated by regulatory ambiguity

**Document Structure:**
- Introduction to the relevant regulatory framework
- Statutory, regulatory, and enforcement penumbra analysis
- Jurisdictional tensions
- Real-world case studies
- Stakeholder impacts
- Recommendations for navigating ambiguity

# Lil LOTL Preview

A condensed, fast-start LOTL pack for teams that need the essentials quickly.
- High-priority obligations by workflow with citation pins, ready to implement the power of the Letter of the Law to working for you, and vice versa. 
- Prebuilt training bullets and job aids -- don't tolerate any educational drift; make sure all of the pieces presented are of high qualiity. 

- Upgrade path to full LOTL stack when ready - when you rely on the Protocol Lexicon, you won't have to worry about "whe does the LOTL stack" update...you will always have a recent addendum and/por section ready for dissemmination, should you choose to commit.

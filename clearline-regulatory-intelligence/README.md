# ClearLine Regulatory Intelligence
## Cannabis Compliance Clarity: From Black-Letter Law to Regulatory Shadows

---

## 🎯 The ClearLine Approach

Most cannabis compliance resources tell you **what the law says**.  
ClearLine tells you **what the law says** AND **where the law is unclear**.

We provide two complementary product lines:

### 📜 LOTL Stack (Letter of the Law)
**The law everyone knows.**  
Official statutes, regulation numbers, settled legal frameworks, industry impact.

### 🌑 Penumbrant Prose Manual
**The regulatory shadows.**  
Gaps, ambiguities, enforcement uncertainties, risk surfaces.

**Together:** Complete regulatory intelligence for informed compliance decisions.

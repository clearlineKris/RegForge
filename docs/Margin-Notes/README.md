# Margin Notes

## Overview
The **Margin Notes** series explores the penumbra of regulatory law—the gray areas, ambiguities, and unarticulated implications within cannabis regulatory frameworks. These documents focus on areas where the law is unclear, unwritten, or subject to interpretation.

## Key Focus Areas
1. **Statutory and Regulatory Ambiguities** - Vague language, undefined terms, and gaps in coverage
2. **Enforcement Discretion** - Inconsistent application across jurisdictions or agencies
3. **Multi-Jurisdictional Tensions** - Conflicts between overlapping regulatory authorities
4. **Case Law and Precedents** - How courts and agencies are filling regulatory gaps
5. **Stakeholder Asymmetry Analysis** - How information and power imbalances are exacerbated by regulatory ambiguity

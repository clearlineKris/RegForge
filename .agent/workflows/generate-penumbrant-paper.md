# Workflow: Penumbrant Paper Synthesis

Use this workflow when requested to create a "Penumbrant" report for a new state or regulatory shift.

## 1. Intelligence Ingestion (The Codex)
- Locate the state-specific **LOTL Stack** or relevant statutes in the Codex.
- Identify the governing body (e.g., OCM in MN, DCC in CA).
- Search for recent enforcement actions or "citation sweeps" in the news.

## 2. Identify the Penumbra (The Gray Area)
- Pinpoint two specific areas where rules are ambiguous (e.g., "reasonable" testing windows, "indirect" marketing).
- Identify the **Enforcement Delta**: The difference between the written rule and real-world implementation.

## 3. Apply the Engines (The Sentinelli layer)
Choose at least two engines to process the data:
- **RecallRepel**: What batches are highest risk?
- **PRFCTpack**: Which labels will trigger the next sweep?
- **RegulaGreen**: Is the waste log the "poison pill"?

## 4. Synthesis (The Alchemical Rhythm)
Draft the paper with these headings:
1.  **The Landscape**: High-level market status.
2.  **The Pressure Points**: Specific regulatory bottlenecks.
3.  **The Penumbra**: The detailed gray-area intelligence.
4.  **The Intervention**: How ClearLine bridges the gap.

## 5. Jimmy Indexing
- Assign the file to the correct Penumbrant sub-folder (e.g., `3.00.c_PEN_Penumbrant_Papers`).
- Ensure metadata matches the **Sentinelli Operational Protocols**.

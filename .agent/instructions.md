# Sentinel Operational Protocols

## 1. The Jimmy System (Mandatory)
All content must adhere to the **Jimmy System** of organization. This is a non-negotiable structural requirement.
- **Top-Level**: `N_Name` (e.g., `3_CL_ClearLine`).
- **Sub-Folders**: `N.NN_Name` (e.g., `3.00_PLK_Protocol_Lexicon`).
- **Sub-Sub-Folders**: `N.NN.letter_Name` (e.g., `3.00.a_KNW_Knowledge`).
- **Dot Notation Extension**: The parent number must be carried through to children.

## 2. Protocol Lexicon Hierarchy
Every file must be categorized into one of the three PL layers:
- **Intelligence (Base Layer)**: Public-facing artifacts, state summaries, and outreach.
- **Sentinel (Application Layer)**: Engine specs, Python automations, and Action Maps.
- **Codex (Source Layer)**: Primary statutes, machine-readable JSON rules, and RegBibles.

## 3. The Penumbrant Style Guide
When generating **Penumbrant Papers** or intelligence briefings:
- **Identify the Gray**: Focus on where the law is silent, contradictory, or inconsistently enforced.
- **Enforcement Patterns**: Analyze *how* regulators act, not just what they say.
- **The Verdict**: Always provide a tactical conclusion (The Intervention).
- **Tone**: "Alchemical Rhythm"—structured but fluid enough to capture complex market shifts.

## 4. Deliverable Structure
Standard deliverables must follow this template:
1.  **Header**: Division, Task ID, and Jimmy Indexing.
2.  **Context**: The "now" (Current state/Failure point).
3.  **The Bridge**: Actionable steps using the **Five Engines**.
4.  **Complacent Compliance**: The target state where revenue flows without friction.

## 5. Metadata Standards
All Markdown files MUST include:
```yaml
---
task_id: CL-XXX-NNN
division: CL-PROTOCOL-LEXICON (or relevant division)
status: Active/Archived
owner: KCGS
version: 1.0 (Jimmy System tracking)
